Heruku

Set up environment variables:
You'll need to set up your environment variables in Heroku.
You can do this through the Heroku dashboard or using the Heroku CLI.
Make sure to set:
- SECRET_KEY
- FLASK_ENV (set to 'production')
- Any other environment variables your app uses


Configure Redis:
If you're using Redis in production,
 you'll need to provision a Redis add-on in Heroku 
 and update your REDIS_URL configuration accordingly.
